#   This script is a CLI stub implemented in Bash.
#   If you happen to be planning to create a Bash-based CLI, this script
#   can serve as a - very basic - starting point.
#
#   Globally installed CLIs benefit from having an associated man page.
#   make-pkg's optional vMAN_ON setting facilitates creation of a man page,
#   but requires the CLI to exhibit specific behaviors, notably producing
#   output of a Markdown-format version of the man page when invoked with
#   --man-source. For more information, visit
#     https://github.com/mklement0/make-pkg
#   and search for 'toggle-man'.

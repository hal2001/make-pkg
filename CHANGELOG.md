# Changelog

Versioning _loosely_ complies with [semantic versioning (semver)](http://semver.org/).
Since this utility is applied only _once_ to a given package - in order to create it -
maintaining compatibility is less important. However, larger changes will be reflected
in higher version-number increases.

<!-- NOTE: An entry template is automatically added each time `make version` is called. Fill in changes afterwards. -->

* **v0.1.0** (2015-05-31):
  * Initial release.
